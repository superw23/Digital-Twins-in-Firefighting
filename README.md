# Digital-Twins-in-Firefighting
Developed a Digital Twin system in C# and Unity3D
â€¢	Developed a Digital Twin system in C# and Unity3D, integrating different machine learning models to predict fire spread and optimize escape routes in real-time, enabling accurate fire spread prediction within a second.
â€¢	Built an interactive 3D fire simulation environment with real-time fire and smoke effects, allowing for immersive training and emergency response planning for users.
â€¢	Code is written by Mingtao Wang as the Final Year Project of University of Nottingham. 
â€¢	Published research findings in an international computational science journal.
